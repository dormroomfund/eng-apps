# What do you like to hack on?

I like to hack on products -- by product I simply mean stuff that interfaces directly with some sort of end-user and/or stakeholder.

I particularly enjoy building products using web technologies -- whether that be progressive web apps, single page apps combined with REST API backends, or even mobile apps using tools like React Native. I enjoy every part of the process, from design and engineering all the way to deployment and devops.


# Which project are you most proud of?

I'm most proud of http://write.itskrish.co -- on the surface level, it seems like Yet-Another-Text-Editor, but it's much more in function.

It's powered by two key constraints:

1. You start by choosing a finite duration within which you'll write
2. If you stop writing for more than a few seconds in that duration, all your writing is erased

This essentially forces the writer to engage in stream-of-consciousness writing, which solves several problems. Traditionally, this concept is used to immerse writers in 'flow' and get writers block out of the way. I've personally been using it for ~7 months to journal regularly. The finite duration has made it a far more accessible routine since I know what I'm getting into each session, and the forced typing makes me type out even the most latent thoughts in my mind. It's been highly effective for me as a journalling tool.

For one, I'm proud of the concept and how effective it is. I'm also extremely proud of the user interface, which I wrote from scratch using just React.js -- I think it's super smooth, fast, and effective.

I'm also proud of how it's been received by users. It had a highly successful ProductHunt launch (200+ upvotes, front-page feature), and still has a loyal userbase to this day.

# What do you feel that you could get out of joining the DRF team?

DRF as an organization interests me because it's an opportunity to affect the trajectory of technology as a whole; the typical engineering opportunity allows you to scale a single point on the trajectory, whereas DRF's field of work relates to the trajectory as a whole.

A lot of my personal purpose within tech boils down to the impact I'm able to have. DRF has a strong platform through which I'd be able to positively impact a lot of different DRF stakeholders, who in turn will have their own specific impact on tech because of that.


# Why are you uniquely capable of doing this job?

I'm uniquely capable of this job because I'd consider myself a jack of many trades and a master of more than one of them. Basically a unicorn :)

More seriously, though, I've been building software products for nearly 5 years now, I've been a student startup founder myself (Inc.com's Coolest College Startups 2016, funded by Rough Draft Ventures, etc), and am also super attentive to the startup/student landscape as it's evolved in the past few years.

I've also developed a powerful network during my time in tech; I was among the earliest members of the student hackathon movement that's now scaled to tens of thousands of students, and am friends with lot of the most valuable people from the original membership. Having a lens into some of the most successful student founders would be a unique asset in building software for students like them.

More about my qualifications, work experiences, and projects can be found in my resume and my personal website (http://itskrish.co).


# What's your most memorable characteristic?

I've heard this at every single internship/long-term contract I've done so far -- I'm really easy to work with because I'm very good at adapting to circumstance and new environments.

Whether it be in the context of hopping into new tech stacks, navigating bureaucracy to achieve certain product goals, or just getting along with people, I've been told that I silently but effectively seem to figure out how to achieve my agenda while leaving things better for everyone I interface with.
