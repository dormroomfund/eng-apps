Hello there! My name is Tristan Wiley, I'm a Software Engineer from the University at Buffalo. I'll get right to the point. I absolutely love hacking on everything, my favorite things to hack on would be Android apps. They're what I started with and, well, I still love working with them! Right now I'm working on a few projects. I think the project I'm most proud of is the startup I'm working on, Outbully. It started off as a hackathon project and has since turned into much more!

Overall, I'd absolutely love to join the DRF team for a few reasons. To start, I absolutely love the goal of the company. Helping students grow their startups is something I find incredibly important. I believe I'm uniquely capable to do this job because of both my connection to the company's goals, and my skills. 

Finally, my most memorable charactoristic is my fantastic puns. Hire me and you'll get plenty.
